This repository contains a Scala example demonstrating an uncommon error related to exception handling within custom setter methods. The example shows how a simple `IllegalArgumentException` can be thrown if the age is set to negative number inside `MyClass` in `bug.scala`. The corresponding `bugSolution.scala` illustrates how to improve the code to handle this exception and preventing program termination.
